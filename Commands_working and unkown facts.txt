FACT-1:-

WC command used for counting lines, words and character of a given file. But how it is done..... Actually it uses the fact of "\n" to count lines and white spaces to count words and sequence of chars to count charaters.
If there is no space in a file then it will treat it as one word and one line which actual no. of characters.
